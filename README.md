Scores Management By KHALIDY IBRAIMO SAFAR

This project was created by Khalidy Safar, using the C# programming language, and SQL Server for database management.

The application consists of a note manager using the scheme of the 3rd year (I and II semesters) of the Degree in Computer Engineering and Telecommunications at the Higher Institute of Transport and Communications (ISUTC), for personal purposes. With this app, students are able to add their notes, visualize, edit and have a set of statistics and settings at their disposal, in addition to a pleasant graphical interface.

The database is local and based on a server on my machine, if the project is changed to a connection using MySQL, this (the application) can be used on any machine, and this is being worked on.

Any suggestion, criticism will be accepted by me, in favor of my development and those who will benefit from this project.
